# Sentiment-Analysis-WebApp
A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that uses a web app to enter text and provides feedback whether the text is positive or negative. The whole point of this project was to demonstrate the use of AWS Sagemaker, AWS Lambda, and AWS Gateway API to orchestrate and trigger the model through an endpoint so that the web app can transmit the text, run the model, and get the result. This project was part of Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.
